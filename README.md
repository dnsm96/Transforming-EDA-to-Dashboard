**Dashboard on EDA**

## **About the Project**

This End Course Summative Assessment aims to create a business intelligence (BI) dashboard based on the same dataset that was used for EDA capstone project which is **Hotel Booking** 

**Problem Statement:**

The hotel industry faces challenges in optimizing revenue and improving customer satisfaction. This project aims to analyze booking patterns, identify factors influencing cancellations, and provide insights to enhance operational efficiency. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we seek to create an intuitive dashboard that enables stakeholders to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies.

**Dataset Selection:**

For this Project we have selected ‘Hotel Booking’ dataset  This dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of various attributes related to cancellation, lead time, type of booking and more. The dataset is ideal for conducting an in-depth exploration of the booking patters and deriving actionable insights.

**Why Hotel Booking:**

Hotel booking platforms provide a comprehensive and convenient solution for travelers to secure accommodations across a wide range of hotel options, from budget-friendly stays to luxury resorts, in cities and destinations worldwide. These platforms emphasize reliability and comfort, offering guests consistent service standards, curated amenities, and extensive customer support. Travelers often prefer hotel bookings for the reassurance of professional management, the availability of facilities like room service, gyms, and pools, and the certainty of established safety measures. Additionally, hotel booking platforms frequently feature rewards programs and exclusive deals, making them attractive for both frequent travelers and those seeking value for their money. Hotels are strategically located in urban centers, popular tourist destinations, and even remote areas, ensuring accessibility and convenience for all kinds of travel needs.

**Hotel Booking Statistics:**
